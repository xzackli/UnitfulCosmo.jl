This leaves one free dimension, and this unit system makes Megaparsec (Mpc) the base unit. In this unit system, both length and time are measured in Mpc, whereas mass, temperature, and current are measured in inverse Mpc. These units are often used for studies of the large scale structure of the Universe. Most cosmological theory codes use these units, in particular because H_0 and wavenumbers k are nice in this system, and a lot of the constants are 1.
